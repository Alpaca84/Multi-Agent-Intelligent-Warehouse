# Evidence Scoring System

## Overview

The Evidence Scoring System provides advanced confidence assessment and quality control for AI responses through multi-factor analysis and intelligent validation.

## Architecture

### Multi-Factor Evidence Scoring

The system evaluates evidence quality using five weighted factors:

1. **Vector Similarity Scoring (30% weight)**
   - Measures semantic similarity between query and retrieved content
   - Uses cosine similarity with configurable thresholds
   - Accounts for query complexity and content length

2. **Source Authority & Credibility (25% weight)**
   - Evaluates source reliability and expertise
   - Considers source type (official docs, user manuals, expert content)
   - Tracks source reputation and validation history

3. **Content Freshness & Recency (20% weight)**
   - Prioritizes recent and up-to-date information
   - Uses temporal decay functions for older content
   - Considers content update frequency and versioning

4. **Cross-Reference Validation (15% weight)**
   - Validates information across multiple sources
   - Identifies conflicting or contradictory information
   - Measures consensus and agreement levels

5. **Source Diversity Scoring (10% weight)**
   - Ensures varied source coverage
   - Prevents bias from single-source dominance
   - Promotes comprehensive information gathering

### Confidence Assessment

#### Thresholds
- **High Confidence**: Evidence score ≥ 0.7
- **Medium Confidence**: 0.4 ≤ Evidence score < 0.7
- **Low Confidence**: Evidence score < 0.4

#### Quality Indicators
- **Source Count**: Minimum 2 distinct sources required
- **Agreement Level**: Cross-source consensus measurement
- **Freshness Score**: Content age and update frequency
- **Authority Score**: Source credibility and expertise

### Intelligent Clarifying Questions

#### Question Generation
- **Context-Aware**: Questions tailored to query type and domain
- **Ambiguity Detection**: Identifies specific areas of uncertainty
- **Priority Ranking**: Critical, high, medium, low priority questions
- **Follow-up Suggestions**: Progressive question refinement

#### Question Types
- **Equipment-Specific**: "Which specific equipment are you asking about?"
- **Location-Specific**: "Which warehouse zone or area?"
- **Time-Specific**: "What time period are you interested in?"
- **Scope-Specific**: "Are you asking about current status or historical data?"

## Implementation

### Evidence Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_evidence_score(evidence_pack):
    """Calculate comprehensive evidence score."""
    
    # Vector similarity (30%)
    vector_score = calculate_vector_similarity(evidence_pack.query, evidence_pack.content)
    
    # Source authority (25%)
    authority_score = evaluate_source_authority(evidence_pack.source)
    
    # Content freshness (20%)
    freshness_score = calculate_content_freshness(evidence_pack.timestamp)
    
    # Cross-reference validation (15%)
    validation_score = validate_cross_references(evidence_pack.sources)
    
    # Source diversity (10%)
    diversity_score = calculate_source_diversity(evidence_pack.sources)
    
    # Weighted combination
    evidence_score = (
        vector_score * 0.30 +
        authority_score * 0.25 +
        freshness_score * 0.20 +
        validation_score * 0.15 +
        diversity_score * 0.10
    )
    
    return evidence_score
```

### Confidence Assessment

```python
def assess_confidence(evidence_score, source_count, agreement_level):
    """Assess overall confidence level."""
    
    if evidence_score >= 0.7 and source_count >= 2 and agreement_level >= 0.8:
        return "high"
    elif evidence_score >= 0.4 and source_count >= 2:
        return "medium"
    else:
        return "low"
```

### Clarifying Questions Engine

```python
def generate_clarifying_questions(query, evidence_pack, confidence_level):
    """Generate context-aware clarifying questions."""
    
    if confidence_level == "low":
        questions = []
        
        # Equipment-specific questions
        if "equipment" in query.lower() and not extract_equipment_id(query):
            questions.append("Which specific equipment are you asking about?")
        
        # Location-specific questions
        if "location" in query.lower() and not extract_location(query):
            questions.append("Which warehouse zone or area?")
        
        # Time-specific questions
        if "status" in query.lower() and not extract_timeframe(query):
            questions.append("What time period are you interested in?")
        
        return prioritize_questions(questions)
    
    return []
```
